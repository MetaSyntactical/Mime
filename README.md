What is MetaSyntactical/Mime?
-----------------------------

MetaSyntactical/Io is part of the MetaSyntactical PHP 5.3+ components library and
provide a system independent implementation of the magic.mime MIMEtype detection.

MetaSyntactical/Mime is based on the [Zend Framework proposal][1] for
Zend_Mime_Magic of Matthew Ratzloff and the derived implementation as [Google Code project][2]
of Sven Vollbehr.
I have transformed the code to use namespaces, better exception handling and added a lot of
unit tests.
